This is an expansion of the default HTML helper that copes with html/xhtml tags automatically.

How it works:
   In app_controller set e.g
      var $helpers = array('Html' => array('html4-strict'));

   If it doesn't work, set this as the first array item.
   The helper takes the option, and populates the $tags array from a $__tags array with both html and xhtml elements in.

   No method changes - this really is it!
